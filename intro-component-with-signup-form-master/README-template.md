### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

Wrapping each input tag, label, and small error tag in a div really helps with styling. This layout also makes grabbing the DOM elements easier with JavaScript

```html
<div id="inputWrapper" class="input-wrapper">
  <input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName" placeholder="First Name">
  <img class="hidden" id="error" src="./images/icon-error.svg" alt="error alert">
  <small class="error hidden" id="error">First Name cannot be empty</small>
</div>
```
The CSS hidden attribute is a cool way to make an element disapear. Unlike  ```display: none;``` the hidden property won't remove margins.  
```css
.hidden {
  visibility: hidden;
  margin: .75rem 0 0 0;
}

```
The querySelector function isn't just for the document object ðŸ˜…. You can use it on any element ( that you've grabbed from the DOM ). I was able to grab the one error message I wanted. First I used the ```input.parentElement``` property to grab the inputWrapper element. Then I did a ```querySelectorAll("#error)``` to grab all the inputWrapper's children elements with an id of error. Gives a NodeList to loop over. NOT an array!
```js
function removeError(input) {
  const inputWrapper = input.parentElement;
  const errorElements = inputWrapper.querySelectorAll("#error");

  errorElements.forEach(element => {
  element.classList.add("hidden");
  });
};
```
